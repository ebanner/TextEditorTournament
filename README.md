Text Editor Tournament
=======================

Client-server system connecting together multiple tournament participants, a manager (administrator), and a web-based display frontend system through a central server.

The server handles distributing challenges submitted by the manager and submissions of answers by the participants. The server and client programs are written in Python 3. The web-based frontend displays information about the tournament in real-time using the HTML5 canvas and WebSockets.
