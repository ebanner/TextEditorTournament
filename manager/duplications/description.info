Duplicating Code

This challenge involves duplicating lines of code. Open "Code.java" and copy
all of the text and paste it right below the existing text, separated by one
empty line. Then change every instance of "myFirstVariable" to
"mySecondVariable" in the copied text. Also, update the print statement in
the copied text to say "My second variable is ...".
