Fixing Compile Errors

Compile TFTPServer.java with "javac TFTPServer.java" from your terminal.
It will not compile: you'll see an error message indicating the error and the
line it happened on. There are THREE mistakes in the code, and they're very
simple. Fix them. Once your code compiles, it means you got it.
