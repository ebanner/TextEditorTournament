Example Challenge

Welcome to Text Editor Tournament 2013. This is an example challenge
designed to get you familiar with the interface. To complete this example
challenge, all you need to do is open the file "example.txt" in your
workspace directory, and change the line from "print(' h e l l o ' )" to
"print('hello')". Use another terminal window or a GUI. Once finished,
simply hit ENTER on your keyboard with your client terminal window focused.
