camelCase to names_with_underscores

Someone likes Java. They like Java soooo much that they've brought over
camelCasing to Python when they should be naming their
variables_with_underscores. Rid them of this nasty habit and set them on the
path to good Python idomaticity!

e.g.

def myFunction():
    myNum = 5
    yourNum = 66
    resultForNow = 9

becomes

def my_function():
    my_num = 5
    your_num = 66
    result_for_now = 9
