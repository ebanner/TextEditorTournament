camelCase to names_with_underscores

Someone likes Java. They like Java soooo much that they've brought over
camelCasing to Python when they should be naming their
variables_with_underscores. Rid them of this nasty habit and set them on the
path to good Python idomaticity!

Note: class names must NOT be converted_to_underscores. Leave them
InTheirCurrentForm.

e.g.

def FooBar:
    yourNum = 10
    myNum = 20
    theNum = yourNum + myNum


becomes

def my_function():
    your_num = 10
    my_num = 20
    the_num = your_num + my_num
