Insert Lines

This challenge is from vimgolf.com! Open "file.rb" and insert two empty lines
between every comment-separated section (except the top). That is, wherever
you see a comment (line starting with "#"), put 2 empty lines above it,
EXCEPT the first line in the file. You should insert a total of 10 new lines.
