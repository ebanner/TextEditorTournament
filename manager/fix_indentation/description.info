Fixing Indentation

Indentation is important. Open up ImageMap.java and fix the bad indentation.
You should not need to remove or create new lines. Only change the
whitespace before each line of code. This example uses SPACES, and NOT TABS.
Make sure your correction also uses SPACES (four spaces per indent).
