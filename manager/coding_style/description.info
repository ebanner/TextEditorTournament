Aligning function arguments to match a specific coding style

Most projects have specific coding style guidelines. In this case, the argument
list must be broken into a new line for each argument, with the argument names
right aligned, taking into account pointers. As usual, do NOT use tabs! Taken

e.g.

void
function(long *my_long,
         unsigned int *my_num,
         int my_int,
         char *my_char)

becomes

void
function(long         *my_long,
         unsigned int *my_num,
         int           my_int,
         char         *my_char)
